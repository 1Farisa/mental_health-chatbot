Mental Health Chatbot Using SVM and TF-IDF

This project implements a simple chatbot for mental health conversations using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model and TF-IDF vectorization. The chatbot is trained on a dataset of user intents and corresponding responses, including newly added intent categories related to common symptoms like headache, dizziness, and cough. The application is built with Streamlit, providing an interactive interface for users to input their queries and receive appropriate responses based on their intent. The chatbot helps guide users by providing responses related to their symptoms or concerns.
